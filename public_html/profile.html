            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>The demons of Hell first gave him the appellation "Doom Slayer" and also refer to him as the Unchained Predator, the Beast, and the Hellwalker. The UAC refers to the Doom Slayer as DOOM Marine, or The Slayer.Before the character had any epithets in the story, he was most commonly called Doomguy in the fan community. This nickname is mentioned in Doom Eternal and used in his dialogue subtitles.He is intended to be the latest iteration and continuation of the classic DOOM Marine who is the protagonist for most of the series. According to Tom Hall and John Romero (who worked on the original Doom), the original iteration of the DOOM Marine was the grandson[6] of Commander Keen and the great-great-grandson of William J. Blazkowicz. Some fan-theories say the Doom Slayer's name could be William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz III but according to official interviews the developers clearly stated he has no name. The Doom Slayer's Blazkowicz ancestry may or may not be canonical for the modern iteration. The developers have originally stated that the protagonist has no canon name because he is a representation of the player. When asked directly on Twitter, John Romero replied humorously that his name really is Doom Guy (with a space, in two words - first word for name and second for surname).</p>
